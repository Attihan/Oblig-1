     "This is unheard of! How could anyone do this?” exclaimed Maria Davidsen, a librarian at Bjørvika library. <br>
     “Thankfully, nobody was hurt, but the damages are extensive. The library is closed until necessary repairs have been made.
     The fire brigade struggled for two hours to put out the flames due to the books and furniture materials.
     The whole library suffered extensive smoke damage.<br><br>
     Police suspect the man, in his early 30s, was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. <br>
     They arrested him at the scene and charged him with breaking and entering and arson. <br>
     He is currently under investigation, and his motive is still unknown. <br><br>

     “It’s a sad day for our community,” said Erik Johansen, a witness to the incident.<br>
      “The library is a valuable resource for people in this area, <br>
      and to see it suffer like this is heartbreaking.”
