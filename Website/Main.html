     Early in the morning, a young man was arrested after breaking into Bjorvika library the very same night.
     According to investigators, the suspect had made a bonfire in the middle of the third floor. <br></p>
     
     <p class="paragrafer">OSLO, NORWAY – Bjørvika library suffered significant material damages in an unfortunate fire caused by a man who broke into the library last night. <br>
        The man made a camping fire right in the middle of the library, causing flames to spread throughout the premises. <br>
        Police and the fire brigade were alerted about the incident around 1 a.m., and they rushed to the scene.</p>
     
     <p class="paragrafer">According to eyewitnesses, the man smashed a glass window to gain entry to the library. <br>
        He then proceeded to build a camping fire in the middle of the library, <br>
        ignoring the fire extinguishers and fire alarms in the vicinity.</p>
     
     <p class="paragrafer">"This is unheard of! How could anyone do this?” <br>
        exclaimed Maria Davidsen, a librarian at Bjørvika library. <br>
        “Thankfully, nobody was hurt, but the damages are extensive. The library is closed until necessary repairs have been made.”<br>
        The fire brigade struggled for two hours to put out the flames due to the books and furniture materials.<br>
        The whole library suffered extensive smoke damage.

     <p class="paragrafer">
        Police suspect the man, in his early 30s, was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. <br>
        They arrested him at the scene and charged him with breaking and entering and arson. <br>
        He is currently under investigation, and his motive is still unknown. <br>
        “It’s a sad day for our community,” said Erik Johansen, a witness to the incident.<br>
         “The library is a valuable resource for people in this area, <br>
         and to see it suffer like this is heartbreaking.”

<p class="paragrafer">The repair cost for Bjørvika library is estimated to be substantial, with some reports suggesting it could reach up to 100 million NOK.</p>
<p class="paragrafer">
     This sad incident emphasizes the importance of taking care of our shared public spaces, <br>
     and the need to ensure they remain a safe and accessible resource for everyone.<br>

     In discussing the perpetrator's mental health, a therapist weighed in on the issue. <br>
     "Without knowing more about the individual in question, it's impossible to say for sure what led them to cause such destruction," the therapist stated. <br>
     "However, we do know that individuals struggling with mental health issues, and addiction, in particular, are more vulnerable to engaging in destructive behavior."
